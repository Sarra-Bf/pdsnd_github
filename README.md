## Credits
1. *Solving errors :* When I faced errors in running the code and I couldn't solve the problem I automatically check [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), in this website  you can find multi-solutions for your errors.
2. *Documentation :* there is a lot of source for documentation in google such as https://docs.python.org/3/library/ and in different languages.
If you're not an English native speaker, it would be better to find resources in your language.
In this project I searched for documentation in my second language *French* and I found this [PDF](http://eric.univ-lyon2.fr/~ricco/tanagra/fichiers/fr_Tanagra_Data_Manipulation_Pandas.pdf) useful to manipulate data with Pandas.
3. Also, video tutorials make learning programming much easier. I found this [Arabic tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fl5MPaFrH4) really helpful.
